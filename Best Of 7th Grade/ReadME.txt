These are a few things that Drippy Development worked on from Sept. 3 2024 -> June 18 2025.

1. Tralalero Tralala internet browser (Started when meme was funny) Status : UNFINISHED. VERY BUGGY.
2. C# Github based file updater (NOT PRESENT HERE) Status : STABLE
3. OpenGL Minecraft Clone (One of many attempts... Most complete somehow...) status : Unfinished, stable, future updates coming.

This is all early source code here for reference. Source here won't be updated. Might be updated in "Best Of 8th Grade" post. Time flies.

Special thanks to:
School Wifi : taught us all patience.
Gavin M. : pressing 1 button and screwing up the Scriptable Render Pipeline.
Celia C. : Repeatedly saying multiple people have "no friends" to mask her own insecurities.
My math teacher : Not explaining Rayleigh and Mie scattering equations. So my asian dad had too. {  No rice for a week >:(   }
Last but not least, thank you to the kind lady who smiled at me in pretty much every orchestra class.

Our favorite programming tricks : 
Crashing everything instead of using pointers.
Comment out code lines that throw errors. (good ol SYFM trick)
“It works on my machine." TM
Refactoring? Nah, just rename the variable and pretend it's new.
Making one change and recompiling the whole universe.
Writing "// TODO" and never looking back.
() => TweakTFOut();
